Snake with multiple apples.

The snake-apple collision system is broken. Must be fixed. (REMOVE x,y instance variables, use rectangle.getX,Y)
Override toString methods for Apple and Snake (must return rectangle data to be reconstructed)
Add save method to engine that uses toString methods while creating data to write to txt
Add load Method to take in data and constructor for a new engine.
Apples do not draw properly. Probably linked to problem one.
